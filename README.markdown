### Joseph Pecoraro's Greasemonkey Scripts

Just a collection of Greasemonkey Scripts that I have written.  Putting
them in a repository will:

  * make it easier for me to reuse some of the techniques I've used in
    these scripts
  * allow me to actually find the scripts when I need to
  * do good version control
